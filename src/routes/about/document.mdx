# About the project

I plan to use an accelerometer and an LCD screen to recreate the tilting ball game shown below. You will be able to
tilt the accelerometer to control a game "plane" that a ball rolls on. The goal is to navigate the ball to a target
hole while avoiding "pits." The MVP consists of a simple tilting "plane" controlled by the accelerometer with a ball
and the target drawn to the screen, additional features would be adding pits and sound effects with a piezo using PWM.

# Parts and Protocols:

Protocol 1: The accelerometer uses I2C  
Protocol 2: The LCD uses SPI  
Peripheral 1: I will use this accelerometer https://www.adafruit.com/product/1231  
Peripheral 2: I will use this LCD display https://www.adafruit.com/product/358
