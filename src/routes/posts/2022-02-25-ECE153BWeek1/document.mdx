## Intro to the project

The goal is to create a game where physically tilting the device causes a virtual ball to roll around on the screen  

The target of the game is to navigate the ball to a target while avoiding 'pits'

## Getting started  

This week I stitched together code from lab 4 to enable SysTick interrupts, I2C communication, and SPI communication.  

I hardcoded the correct I2C module into the code since it's the only one I'm using and found the commands to enable measurement on the accelerometer

After soldering on the header rows for the accelerometer and the display I was able to wire the I2C bus on the accelerometer to pins B6 and B7 on the
Nucleo board.

The following command enables the measurement mode of the accelerometer:
```c
// Write 0x08 to register 0x2D (POWER_CTL) to enable measurement
uint8_t powerCTLCFG[] = {0x2D, 0x08};
I2C_SendData(ACCELEROMETER, powerCTLCFG, 2);
```

Then we can read registers `0x32` through `0x37` to receive the high and low bits for the X, Y, & Z axes. Dividing these values by 256 to
scales them to be in units of 1g.

```c
void updateAccelerationValues(){	
	// Set the base address of our reads
	uint8_t measurementRegistersBase[] = {0x32U};
	I2C_SendData(ACCELEROMETER, measurementRegistersBase, 1);
	
	// Read register 0x32-0x37 for accelerometer data
	uint8_t data[6];
	I2C_ReceiveData(ACCELEROMETER, data, 6);
	
	// Combine readings into 16bits and divide each by 256
	accx = (int16_t)(data[0] | (data[1] << 8)) / 256.0;
	accy = (int16_t)(data[2] | (data[3] << 8)) / 256.0;
	accz = (int16_t)(data[4] | (data[5] << 8)) / 256.0;
}
```
Before dividing by 256 we convert to a `uint16_t` to sign the values. The they are stored in global scope variables.  

Using the debugger watch window I was able to see the 3 axes properly changing meaning the this device is fully working.  

My plan for the next two weeks is to get the display running and drawing circles (pits and balls) during week 9 and implement game logic for week 10.
