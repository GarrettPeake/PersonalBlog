## Saturday 3/5

After studying the Adafruit and Github libraries for the display I've debugged and seemingly have a startup sequence working.

I configured SPI what seems to be correctly, even though it uses 4 wires, data is transferred on a single wire bidirectionally.

I began using pin PB2 as a chip select and PB5 as data/command select. To begin interaction, you pull the chip select low (serial communication is
initialized while it's high) then we can transmit a byte of information and the D/C pin will be sampled on the 8th byte, if we want to keep transmitting
just don't bring the chip select back up and we can transmit more commands, arguments, and data. Finally to end a transfer just bring the chip select high again

To run the display, you must take it out of sleep mode, set some settings, and set the column and row address space. After setting the address space,
just send the RAMWR command and you can begin writing color values to the bus. These colors will be converted into pixels based on the configured 12/16/24
bit color space. I'm using 16 bit so I write 5 red bits, 6 green bits, and 5 blue bits. After each 16 bits are written the cursor indexes one step in reading
direction.

The code still does not display anything, tomorrow I will make sure PB2/5 are outputting correctly.

## Sunday 3/6

Today I've confirmed that the chip select and D/C pins are correctly modulating and are in the correct states based on the values I'm trying to write.
After running the setup commands I found on ADAFRUIT I begin writing.

Note: I missed a third portion of the startup command scripts and just successfully got the screen to display blue!

I can now write pixels continuously to the screen and after decreasing the SPI prescaler have a reasonably fast framerate. I can then write some utilities
to let me draw circles for the pits and the ball.

```c
void write_frame(){
	SPI_init_transfer();
	SPI_Write_Command(ST77XX_RAMWR); // Start writing to RAM
	for(int i = 0; i < ST7735R_WIDTH*ST7735R_HEIGHT; i++){ // Write the colors for each pixel in the buffer
		SPI_Write_Data((uint8_t)(frame_data[i] >> 8));
		SPI_Write_Data((uint8_t)(frame_data[i]));
	}
	SPI_end_transfer();
}

void set_pixel(uint16_t x, uint16_t y, uint16_t color){
	frame_data[y*ST7735R_WIDTH + x] = color;
}

void clear_buffer(uint16_t color){
	for(uint16_t x = 0; x < ST7735R_WIDTH; x++){
		for(uint16_t y = 0; y < ST7735R_HEIGHT; y++){
			set_pixel(x, y, color);
		}
	}
}
void set_circle(uint16_t x, uint16_t y, uint8_t rad, uint16_t color){
	for(uint16_t cx =   MAX(0, x-rad); cx < MIN(ST7735R_WIDTH,  x+rad); cx++){
		for(uint16_t cy = MAX(0, y-rad); cy < MIN(ST7735R_HEIGHT, y+rad); cy++){
			if(rad*rad > MAX(x-cx, cx-x)*MAX(x-cx, cx-x) + MAX(y-cy, cy-y)*MAX(y-cy, cy-y)){
				set_pixel(cx, cy, color);
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Using the above code, during each frame we can wipe the canvas using clear_buffer, draw our circles using set_circle, draw singles pixels if we like, and
then write the entire buffer to the display using write_frame.

Interestingly, the datasheet claims that in 16bit RGB red comes first and blue last, but when interacting with it, it appears that blue must come first.

Over the next few days I will be implementing the game logic and integrating the accelerometer back in.

# Tuesday 3/8

Today I implemented the game loop, implemented collisions between the player and the pits and goal. Finally I added win and loss screens.
The player is also bound to the play area but I would like to implement some sort of bouncing off the walls.

On thursday I will plug the accelerometer in and after an axis flip or two the game should be fully playable. I might even implement level
progressions

# Thursday 3/10 - DONE!
