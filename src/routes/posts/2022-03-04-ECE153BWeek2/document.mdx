## SPI LCD Display

The goal for this week was to begin interfacing with the SPI LCD display  

The display runs on the ST7735R driver. There's multiple libraries available for the device but all for different platforms  

It took me a while to figure out the wiring since we've only interacted with 3-wire SPI and this requires 5: MISO, MOSI, SCK, D/C, TFT_CS  

I procrastinated this week and didn't manage to achieve the goal of displaying anything so will be debugging throughout the coming week

## Getting started  

Using the SPI GPIO setup code from Lab 3 I wrote two new functions to send data and to send commands.

```c
void SPI_Write_Data(uint8_t data){
	uint8_t* doof;
	// Pull D/C high for data
	GPIOB->ODR |= 0x1U << 2;
	// Transfer the data
	SPI_Transfer_Byte(data, doof);
}
```

```c
void SPI_Write_Command(uint8_t command){
	uint8_t* doof;
	// Pull D/C low for command
	GPIOB->ODR &= ~(0x1U << 2);
	// Transfer the command
	SPI_Transfer_Byte(command, doof);
}
```

I originally tied the TFT_CS to low but looking at the timing diagram from the [datasheet](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ST7735R_V0.2.pdf)
I saw that it also needed to be modulated. I made the same mistake with the D/C pin before I realized its purpose. I made many mistakes during the
wiring process on this board.

I found a startup sequence from the Adafruit ST7735 library and ported it to work with my scheme

Then I found a basic drawing scripts for this driver from [this github](https://github.com/juj/ST7735R)

```c
void begin_rect(uint8_t x0, uint8_t y0, uint8_t x1, uint8_t y1){
	SPI_Write_Command(ST77XX_CASET); // Column address set
	SPI_Write_Data(0);  //XSTART[15:8]
	SPI_Write_Data(x0); //XSTART[7:0]
	SPI_Write_Data(0);  //XEND[15:8]
	SPI_Write_Data(x1); //XEND[7:0]
	SPI_Write_Command(ST77XX_RASET);
	SPI_Write_Data(0);  //YSTART[15:8]
	SPI_Write_Data(y0); //YSTART[7:0]
	SPI_Write_Data(0);  //YEND[15:8]
	SPI_Write_Data(y1); //YEND[7:0]
	SPI_Write_Command(ST77XX_RAMWR); // RAM Write
}

void begin_pixels(){
	begin_rect(0, 0, ST7735R_WIDTH-1, ST7735R_HEIGHT-1);
}

void pixel(uint16_t x, uint16_t y, uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue){
	uint8_t hi = HI8_RGB24(red, green, blue);
	SPI_Write_Command(ST77XX_RAMWR);
	SPI_Write_Data(hi);
	uint8_t lo = LO8_RGB24(red, green, blue);
	SPI_Write_Data(lo);
}
```

All of this comes with many steps of debugging, porting, and refactoring in between.

After running the above code the SPI bus gets stuck waiting for the busy flag to become unset suggesting that the communication is the problem.

The plan until the project is due to is attempt to debug for at least an hour each day to get the display working and I believe the game logic won't
very long
